### JR Pass

After [comparing our itinerary’s train costs](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) with the Japan Rail Pass, we opted for the [Kansai-Hokuriku Area Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_kansai_hokuriku.html). The varying JR Passes provide unlimited use of various shinkansen, limited express trains, local trains, and even some buses. It’s important to note that while the JR Pass covers the entire country, regional passes are specific to certain areas, so research before purchasing is crucial.

#### Exchange Orders and Ticket Vending Machines

JR regional passes can be bought on JR West, JR East, or JR Central websites, the JR global website, or through third-party travel agencies (we used Klook, saving a few dollars). Whether purchased through Japan Rail or not, you receive a physical or virtual voucher __(read: exchange order)__ that needs to be exchanged for a physical pass __in person__. This can be done at a ticket vending machine or ticket office, but __regional passes can only be exchanged at their respective JR stations.__

As we chose the Kansai-Hokuriku Pass, a JR West Pass, we had to go to a JR West station to exchange our voucher. For us, this meant stopping in Toyama for the pass before heading to Kanazawa. This minor inconvenience was overshadowed by the fact that the Shinkansen ride from Toyama to Kanazawa was fully covered by our new, shiny pass. [Photo of Kansai-Hokuriku Area Pass]

Note that JR West’s “Green Ticket Machines” differ from JR East’s ticket vending machines so the process is slightly different. 

In order to receive your physical pass you’ll need to:
1. Find the correct ticket machine with the Passport logo above the screen <img src="/assets/jrpassport.png" width="25">.  [Insert Photo of Green Ticket Machine]
2. Select “Receive Reserved Tickets”
3. Select Exchange Order
4. Scan your voucher’s QR Code.
5. Enter the effective date (usually the same day).
6. Agree to the Terms and Conditions 
7. When prompted, scan your passport
8. Once the machine reads your passport, the tickets will print.

##### Important Notes:
- The physical credit card used to purchase the voucher online may be required. Avoid using numberless or virtual cards.
- The pass validity starts and ends at midnight, counting the effective date as a full day regardless of when you receive it.
- To exchange your voucher at a Green Ticket Machine, your passport must have a biometric chip (look for this symbol on your passport) <img src="/assets/biometric.png" width="50">
- Exchange your voucher within 90 days of purchase; don't buy it more than 90 days before your trip
With your JR Pass in hand, you'll likely want to do one of three things: hop on a city bus, take a train, or reserve your seat for a shinkansen/limited express.

#### JR Local Buses
JR local buses don't operate in every city, so check the [JRPass website](https://www.jrailpass.com/buses) to see if they're available where you're going. Our regional pass had us covered for the local buses in Kanazawa and Kyoto. Though the JR bus lines are limited, the process was straightforward:
1. Board the bus (You may see people scanning their IC cards or taking tickets, but you can skip this if your pass covers the local bus).
2. Signal the driver to stop by pressing the yellow “Stop” button at your desired stop (You’ll see the next stop name displayed in romanized characters at the front).
3. Show your pass to the driver before getting off.

Don’t make the mistake of getting on a city bus and trying to show your JR pass to the driver. JR buses typically have a JR logo slapped on the front and back of the bus (in my experience, they’re also a different color than the city buses).

#### JR Local, Rapid, and Express Trains & Other Non-Reserved Seats
If you're traveling on a JR local train, simply slide your pass through the gate’s designated “ticket” slot at the platform. Don’t worry, the pass will be returned to you at the other end of the gate. __Gates labeled “IC” won't have a slot for your ticket. It's also important to note that if your pass doesn't have a black backside, you can't use the gate and must show it to an attendant on duty__ (usually near the gates or in a designated window).

When you arrive at your destination, send your pass through the ticket gate again, and it will be returned to you.

__This only works at JR stations for JR lines__ (their entrances are generally separate from other local lines). If you try to use a non-JR ticket gate, your ticket will still be returned to you, but you'll hear a buzzing sound and see a red X or error message saying, “this ticket cannot be accepted at this gate”.

#### Reserving Seats for Shinkansen and Limited Express Trains

##### Reserving Seats with a JR Pass
1. Find the correct ticket machine. For JR West lines, look for the Green Ticket Machine.
2. Select the option that says “Reserve seat using coupon ticket” or “Reserve seat using discount ticket” (if you don’t see this option, you’re at the wrong machine!).
3. Insert your JR pass into the machine (the slot where you should insert your pass will light up and flash).
4. Select the departure and arrival stations
5. Select the departure time
6. Follow the system prompts for the car and seat selection
7. Confirm your selections
8. Take your passes and tickets (a receipt will be printed as well). 

If you're heading straight from the machine to the platform, keep both your pass and ticket(s) handy! You'll need both to pass through the gate. Assuming your pass has a magnetic stripe (identified by its black backside), __insert both your pass and ticket(s) into the allocated slot at the ticket gate simultaneously__ (literally put both in at the same time). Both your pass and ticket(s) will be returned to you on the other side of the gate. __When exiting the gate at your destination station, the ticket(s) will be collected, and only your pass will be returned.__

Traveling to Japan can be an exciting and enriching experience, but the preparation process can be overwhelming. As I planned my trip to Japan, I delved deep into research to gather information on transportation, the dozens of JR passes, IC cards, and the cities I was visiting. My goal was to feel confident and well-prepared before setting foot on Japanese soil. I found myself asking more questions than I was finding answers to. The abundance of information scattered across various sources prompted me to compile everything into one comprehensive guide to assist fellow travelers in navigating Japan with ease. 

Reflecting on my incredible journey in Japan, I felt compelled to share my insights to help others avoid common frustrations and fully immerse themselves in the beauty of this unique country. This blog serves as a culmination of my personal experiences and research, aimed at empowering travelers to make the most of their trip and enjoy every moment without the stress of uncertainty. It is by no means complete, and I plan to work on it bit by bit.

## Transportation

### JR Pass

After [comparing our itinerary’s train costs](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) with the Japan Rail Pass, we opted for the [Kansai-Hokuriku Area Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_kansai_hokuriku.html). The varying JR Passes provide unlimited use of various shinkansen, limited express trains, local trains, and even some buses. It’s important to note that while the JR Pass covers the entire country, regional passes are specific to certain areas, so research before purchasing is crucial.

#### Exchange Orders and Ticket Vending Machines

JR regional passes can be bought on JR West, JR East, or JR Central websites, the JR global website, or through third-party travel agencies (we used Klook, saving a few dollars). Whether purchased through Japan Rail or not, you receive a physical or virtual voucher __(read: exchange order)__ that needs to be exchanged for a physical pass __in person__. This can be done at a ticket vending machine or ticket office, but __regional passes can only be exchanged at their respective JR stations.__

As we chose the Kansai-Hokuriku Pass, a JR West Pass, we had to go to a JR West station to exchange our voucher. For us, this meant stopping in Toyama for the pass before heading to Kanazawa. This minor inconvenience was overshadowed by the fact that the Shinkansen ride from Toyama to Kanazawa was fully covered by our new, shiny pass.

</p>

Note that JR West’s “Green Ticket Machines” differ from JR East’s ticket vending machines so the process is slightly different. 

In order to receive your physical pass you’ll need to:
1. Find the correct ticket machine with the Passport logo above the screen, as seen in the picture below
2. Select “Receive Reserved Tickets”
3. Select Exchange Order
4. Scan your voucher’s QR Code
5. Enter the effective date (usually the same day)
6. Agree to the Terms and Conditions 
7. When prompted, scan your passport
8. Once the machine reads your passport, the tickets will print

</p>

##### Important Notes:
- The physical credit card used to purchase the voucher online may be required. Avoid using numberless or virtual cards.
- The pass validity starts and ends at midnight, counting the effective date as a full day regardless of when you receive it.
- To exchange your voucher at a Green Ticket Machine, your passport must have a biometric chip (look for this symbol on your passport): <br> <img src="/assets/biometric.png" width="50">
- Exchange your voucher within 90 days of purchase; don't buy it more than 90 days before your trip
With your JR Pass in hand, you'll likely want to do one of three things: hop on a city bus, take a train, or reserve your seat for a shinkansen/limited express.

#### JR Local Buses
JR local buses don't operate in every city, so check the [JRPass website](https://www.jrailpass.com/buses) to see if they're available where you're going. Our regional pass had us covered for the local buses in Kanazawa and Kyoto. Though the JR bus lines are limited, the process was straightforward:
1. Board the bus (You may see people scanning their IC cards or taking tickets, but you can skip this if your pass covers the local bus).
2. Signal the driver to stop by pressing the yellow “Stop” button at your desired stop (You’ll see the next stop name displayed in romanized characters at the front).
3. Show your pass to the driver before getting off.

Don’t make the mistake of getting on a city bus and trying to show your JR pass to the driver. JR buses typically have a JR logo slapped on the front and back of the bus (in my experience, they’re also a different color than the city buses).

#### JR Local, Rapid, and Express Trains & Other Non-Reserved Seats
If you're traveling on a JR local train, simply slide your pass through the gate’s designated “ticket” slot at the platform. Don’t worry, the pass will be returned to you at the other end of the gate. __Gates labeled “IC” won't have a slot for your ticket. It's also important to note that if your pass doesn't have a black backside, you can't use the gate and must show it to an attendant on duty__ (usually near the gates or in a designated window).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/jrpassticket.png" width="600">
</p>
When you arrive at your destination, send your pass through the ticket gate again, and it will be returned to you.

__This only works at JR stations for JR lines__ (their entrances are generally separate from other local lines). If you try to use a non-JR ticket gate, your ticket will still be returned to you, but you'll hear a buzzing sound and see a red X or error message saying, “this ticket cannot be accepted at this gate”.

#### Reserving Seats for Shinkansen and Limited Express Trains
[Insert photo of ticket vending machines]
##### Reserving Seats with a JR Pass
1. Find the correct ticket machine. For JR West lines, look for the Green Ticket Machine.
2. Select the option that says “Reserve seat using coupon ticket” or “Reserve seat using discount ticket” (if you don’t see this option, you’re at the wrong machine!).
3. Insert your JR pass into the machine (the slot where you should insert your pass will light up and flash).
4. Select the departure and arrival stations
5. Select the departure time
6. Follow the system prompts for the car and seat selection
7. Confirm your selections
8. Take your passes and tickets (a receipt will be printed as well). 

If you're heading straight from the machine to the platform, keep both your pass and ticket(s) handy! You'll need both to pass through the gate. Assuming your pass has a magnetic stripe (identified by its black backside), __insert both your pass and ticket(s) into the allocated slot at the ticket gate simultaneously__ (literally put both in at the same time). Both your pass and ticket(s) will be returned to you on the other side of the gate. __When exiting the gate at your destination station, the ticket(s) will be collected, and only your pass will be returned.__

</p>

_Important Notes:_ 

- _Not all Green Ticket Machines are created equal. __Make sure to use a machine that mentions “Shinkansen”, “Reserved and Non-Reserved Tickets” or “Pass OK” nearby__. These machines usually have a large green sign above them._
- _Some __smaller stations may not have this reserved seat ticket machine.__ If this is the case, flag down a JR attendant or find a JR Ticket Office for help._
- _When inserting multiple passes into the machine, wait for the screen to recognize each pass before inserting another._
- _Unless you have a green car JR Pass, __select the “ordinary car” option__ to avoid an additional “Green Car” fee._
- _You can only reserve seats six times at a ticket machine; additional reservations must be made at a ticket office._
- _If you plan to use a non-reserved car, you can bypass the ticket vending machine and go directly through the gate with only your JR pass (note: __some trains only have reserved cars__, so check the train’s details beforehand)._
- _The Nozomi and Mizuho trains are __not__ covered by any JR area passes._
- _Ticket machine lines can be long, but they're usually shorter inside the station (just insert your JR pass to get through the JR gate and obtain the reserved seat ticket from a machine inside). Plan accordingly!_


##### Reserving Seats Without a JR Pass
1. Locate the correct ticket machine. 
2. Select “Reserve Seat(s)”.
3. Select the train type (i.e. limited express, rapid, shinkansen…)
4. Ensure the departure station is correct 
5. Select your arrival station
6. Select the departure time
7. Follow system prompts for the number and type of passengers
8. Choose either “one-way” or “round-trip” (if selecting round-trip, fill out the details before continuing; if undecided, choose one-way).
9. Follow system prompts for car and seat selection.
10. Confirm your selections.
11. When prompted, insert your card or cash.
12. Take your ticket(s) and receipt.

You’ll insert the ticket(s) into the gate's slot when passing through and/or when leaving your destination station.

__It’s important to note that you need both a basic fare ticket and a limited express ticket for limited express trains and shinkansen.__ When prompted by the ticket vending machine, be sure to select that you need both.

If you, like me, make the mistake of purchasing only one of the two required tickets before continuing to the gate, don’t worry; the gate will give you an error and return your ticket to you. You can also return to a ticket machine to purchase the correct accompanying ticket. Save yourself a step and select “both”.

**Pro-Tip: __If you sit on the North/West side of the Tokaido Shinkansen (Nozomi, Hikari, and Kodoma), you’ll have a front-row (read: window) seat to view Mt. Fuji in all its glory.__ For our Nozomi shinkansen, this meant sitting in the D/F seats. Mind you, these seats were BOOKED UP when we were reserving our seats, but we managed to get 2 seats in a green car. We had to wait an additional 45 minutes or so, but it was worth it! Reserve your seats early for this ride.

### Non-JR Lines vs. JR Lines

#### Major Similarities and Differences

__Non-JR lines often offer faster, more direct urban routes and include services like limited express and rapid trains, while JR lines cover more rural and intercity areas.__ The high-speed Shinkansen, operated by JR companies such as JR East, JR Central, and JR West, contrasts with JR's slower conventional trains, making the JR Pass a valuable option for long-distance travel. __Note that most cities lack a local JR bus service.__

__Transfers between JR and non-JR lines at stations require exiting one system and entering another due to separate operations,__ so don’t be surprised if you’re seemingly being led outside the station when transferring lines.
If you purchase a JR pass, I’d recommend using [Navitime’s route feature](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/route/) to plan your routes. Unlike Google Maps, Navitime allows you to prioritize transport with different JR area passes. However, we found that Google Maps had the most up-to-date fare information for both JR and non-JR lines.

#### City Buses (Non-JR)

Note that most cities lack a local JR bus service at all. In the cities that do have a JR Bus, the lines are limited. For example, Kyoto has one JR bus line, while Kanazawa has two, both serving major tourist spots. Non-JR city buses usually offer more frequent stops and services—such as every 15 minutes in Kyoto, compared to 30 minutes for JR buses.
[Insert Kyoto Bus JR Line]

1. Use an IC card (more on this below) to tap on and off of the bus or have exact change ready.
2. Tap your IC card or take a ticket when boarding.
3. If you take a ticket upon boarding, your fare is determined by the zone you enter and the zone you exit. 
4. Press the stop button in advance to signal your stop. 
5. Pay the fare by inserting your ticket and the required cash into the fare machine, or tap your IC card again at the reader near the driver.


- Aside from Tokyo, you’ll board most buses through the rear door and exit through the front door near the driver. 
- Most buses do not provide change, so make sure to bring exact change, bring notes to exchange at the front of the bus (using the change machine) or use an IC Card
- Google was always accurate when it came to the fare estimates
- In some cities, like Kyoto (230¥), there is a flat fare

#### Tokyo Subways vs. Trains

- Subway system (Non-JR)
  + Used for intra-city travel within central Tokyo
  + Extensive coverage and frequent services
  + Great for short-distance trips and accessing various neighborhoods
- Yamanote and Chuo Trains (JR Lines)
  + Operated by JR East
  + Provide essential connections within Greater Tokyo
  + Relied upon for both regional and intra-city travel

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/jr-line-map-tokyo.jpg" width="600">  
</p>

Overall, the subway system tends to be more heavily utilized for day-to-day travel within central Tokyo, while JR trains are relied upon for both regional and intra-city travel. It’s crucial to keep this in mind when deciding on whether you should purchase a JR pass for Tokyo or not. __While we made use of both the Yamanote and Chuo lines during our 7-day stay in Tokyo, the subway system was our primary mode of transportation, as it provided a wider range of destinations.__

### IC Cards

#### Getting an IC Card
There are numerous IC cards out there. I had read online that __these cards are generally compatible and interchangeable with each other.__ So, we each added 3,000¥ (about $20 USD at the time) to our virtual Suica cards via Apple Wallet, and we were ready to go. However, we cluelessly tried scanning our Suica cards while getting on the city bus in Kanazawa. Fortunately, a young gentleman (presumably a local hero) saved us some embarrassment by explaining Suica doesn’t work on this line. He pointed at the app on his phone, showing the ICOCA card he had installed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/suica-pasmo-icoca-suica logo.jpg" width="600">  
</p>

All this to say, there are various types of IC cards: Suica, Pasmo, ICOCA, Kitaca, and Sugoca to name a few… So do your research on which IC card will be accepted at the cities you are visiting. Other than the city bus line in Kanazawa, we were able to use our Suica card everywhere we went, including Kyoto and Nara.

Side note: __While IC cards can be reloaded at essentially any IC Card machine, new cards can only be issued in their appropriate region.__ ICOCA will be the default choice for those starting their adventure in Osaka. Suica or Pasmo are the options for those starting off in Tokyo. There are others, but I think it’s wise to get your card right off the bat. For the majority of people, this will either be in Osaka or Tokyo.

Once you have identified the type of IC card that will work best for you, you’ll need to get your hands on one.

__If you’re the proud owner of an iPhone, the easiest thing to do is to [add the transit](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105079) card to your Apple Wallet. This is only available for Suica, Pasmo, and ICOCA.__ This is only available for Suica, Pasmo, and ICOCA. It is possible to download multiple Suica cards on your phone so, while I didn’t try this, I’m assuming it’s possible to scan in your iPhone-less travel companions (so long as you let them pass through the gate first).

Having the virtual card saved us a ton of time and energy searching for IC recharge stations, since we were able to load the cards with funds via Apple Pay.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/iphone-transit-cards.PNG" width="200">  
</p>

__If you don’t have an iPhone; however, you’ll need to pick up a physical card at one of the IC Machines.__ They’re easy to identify, as they are generally painted pink or black. We never got physical cards, so I don’t have any experience using these machines, but we did see there were different machines for receiving new physical cards and recharging your existing card.

Unless using iPhone’s virtual card or the Welcome Suica/Pasmo Passport (special card for tourists), you’ll need to make a 500¥ deposit, which you’ll get back upon returning the card at the end of your trip. ICOCA operates similarly.

Previously, the standard physical cards had a tendency to sell out, so it’s advised to get the tourist IC Card ([such as the Pasmo Passport](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/)). Suica’s tourist card, Welcome Suica, can only be picked up at Haneda airport and must be ordered in advance. The IC Card information and availability changes frequently so be sure to check the official Pasmo or JR websites for the most up-to-date information regarding IC cards and where to get them.

Unlike with a virtual card, if you are traveling with children between the ages of 6 and 11, you can purchase a reduced-fare IC card for them by getting a physical card in-person at an office (be sure to bring documents that prove your child’s age).

#### Using an IC Card
IC Cards can be used almost anywhere a credit card can be used; just look for the logo at the storefront or cash register.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/accepted-payment-methods.jpg" width="600">  
</p>

These smart cards are incredibly useful. Here are just a few things you can buy with your shiny Suica:
- Bus Fare
- Subway Fare
- Train Fare
- Shinkansen Basic Fare
- Meals at some restaurants
- Convenience store purchases
- Vending Machine Items

__Whether using a virtual or physical card, you only need to tap your card at the ticket gate or bus fare reader to use it.__ Once scanned, your new balance will be displayed on the screen at ticket gates. __Both iPhone and Android users can download a card reader to check the balance of the card__ (this is different from the virtual card app or transit card available for iPhone).

While I primarily used the SUICA for transportation and purchases at 7/11, I noticed the Suica logo almost everywhere I saw the Mastercard logo, from duty-free stores to restaurants.

#### Reloading an IC Card

If you have a virtual card, you can reload it simply with Apple Pay. Otherwise, you can reload it at a recharge machine (the machine must have a scanner) with cash.
For those with a physical card, you will need to reload your card at an IC recharge machine. Unfortunately, this must be done with cash in 1000¥ increments. For those with a physical Pasmo card, you can reload the card on [select buses and at some shops](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/charge/) and convenience stores.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/purchase-new-ic-screen.jpg">  
</p>

**Pro-Tip: If using a virtual card, you can reload your Suica at a recharge machine with any remaining Yen notes that you have left over at the end of your trip. We managed to zero out our Suica balances by doing this and by loading the exact additional amount needed to purchase some coffee and duty-free items at the airport.

## Before Your Flight and Upon Arrival

### Japan Requirements and Entry
#### Complete the immigration form on the Visit Japan website. 
- There are two sections to this  immigration form. The first section consists of filling out your personal information, uploading a picture of your passport, and entering in the details of your accommodation (first night) and flight. 
The second section of the form includes acknowledging Japan’s customs and declarations laws. 
Once both sections are complete you will have access to download your QR Code. Having the QR code completed and ready to go at least 24 hours ahead of time can save you a lot of time at the airport. 
- Upload your passport information to your airline’s website if they allow it. In the US, airlines are required to verify passenger’s information before boarding. To save yourself the hassle at the airport and to prevent any issues from arising close to your departure date, you should take advantage of any resources the airline offers to input your passport and contact information well in advance. 
- Upon entry into Japan, you will be required to have your fingerprints scanned and your picture taken. While there are exceptions to this (such as a child under 16), expect to go through multiple stages of biometric verification. 
- By the time you pass through the initial Immigration/Customs gate, you’ll already have scanned your fingerprints, had your photo taken, scanned your passport, and scanned your QR code at least once, if not multiple times. You’ll immediately make your way into the baggage area, but don’t put your documents away quite yet. 
On the other side of the baggage area, you’ll see groups of 5-6 kiosks. You’ll want to locate an available one and then proceed to fill out the prompted information. You’ll scan your passport, your QR code, and you will be asked to fill out the customs form again here for each member of your party. 
Once completed, you can proceed to the final gate. My partner and I didn’t check any bags, so we proceeded through a metal-detector and were on our merry way. However, it looked like those with checked bags were getting them screened (via x-ray) before proceeding forward.
- After researching older forums, I found that most people spent anywhere between 10-20 minutes in immigration. While the process was extremely quick, the line was long. We prepared the QR code and filled out all of the information through United about 2 weeks in advance. We also didn’t check any bags, and the process took us about 40 minutes after deboarding. 
- I do recommend taking a look at Japan’s Ministry of Health website before packing. Japan’s drug (medicine) laws are much stricter than in the U.S. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines that we may take for granted in our home countries are often banned in Japan. Marijuana and adderall are two examples of a no-exceptions, prohibited drug.

#### Packing Checklist
To avoid having to carry heavy luggage around, my partner and I decided to forego checking in any luggage. In fact, between the two of us we only took one 35L carry-on and one standard backpack to Japan. By utilizing compression packs, we managed to fit mostly everything in the Travel Pack carry-on alone. The standard back contained a sweatshirt, our chargers/adapters, our discreet fanny pack, and a lot of empty space (room for souvenirs). Before I start, I should probably mention that my partner (M) and myself (F) are both U.S. mediums, and wear lighter fabrics like cotton. We stayed in Japan for 2 weeks, and we both packed 7 days worth of clothes. See below for the full packing list:

Apparel (F):
- 4 short-sleeved tees
- 3 long-sleeved tees
- 1 Men’s short-sleeved tee (for sleeping)
- 1 pair of pants (not jeans)
- 1 maxi skirt
- Crop pajama pants
- 6 pairs of underwear
- 1 sports bra
- 1 wireless bra
- 6 pairs of low-cut socks
- 1 pair of crew socks

In addition, I wore the following to the airport: socks, underwear, bra, cardigan, weatherproof jacket, short sleeve tee, walking shoes, and knee braces.

Apparel (M):
- 6 short-sleeve tees
- 1 pair of joggers
- 6 pairs of underwear
- 6 pairs of low-cut socks
- 1 sweatshirt/hoodie

In addition, he wore the following to the airport: socks, windproof/water-resistant jacket, short-sleeve tee, and shoes

Toiletries:
- Quart-Sized bag for travel-sized liquids
- Conditioner
- Shampoo
- Hand Soap
- Face Lotion
- Body Lotion
- Sunscreen
- Body Wash
- Face Wash
- Toothpaste
- Face-Cleaning Wipes
- Deodorant (2)
- Tweezers
- Electric Toothbrush + Case (2)
- Hairbrush
- 2 Scrunchies
- Mascara
- Tula Under-Eye Brightener

Electronics:
- Beard Trimmer
- Outlet Adapter
- Portable Charger (2) and accompanying wires
- Charger + 2 charging cables
- Apple Airpods Max
- Apple Airpods Pro

Medications: 
- Pack of Tums 
- Box of Pepto Bismol
- Box of Claritin

Misc:
- Eco-Friendly laundry sheets (18)
- Small foot roller + lacrosse ball + Peanut Roller
- Folder filled with travel Documents
- Discreet fanny pack with backup credit cards, cash, debit cards and passport
- 40 oz Hydroflask
- 30oz Brita Filter Bottle (which I carried around in a crossbody, water bottle pouch)
- Packable backpack (once we started buying souvenirs, we took it out and started filling it )
- Neck Pillow for flight
- Sweat-wicking Hankies / Hand Towels
- Compression Cubes (for packing all the clothes in)

There are plenty of things on this list that I would remove if I did it all over again. The “unnecessary list” includes the peanut roller, lacrosse ball, maxi skirt, wireless bra, beard trimmer, and sweatshirt. 

Now I understand that this list is not for everyone. I traded glamorous outfits and makeup for practicality. Hopefully you can use this as a guideline on how to minimize packing for a 2 week trip. While it was tough to leave my cute (albeit, bulky) sweaters at home, I thanked my past self every time I saw anyone lugging around their luggage. 

It is common, however, for hotels to offer luggage delivery services where, for a price, your luggage can get shipped to your next hotel for you. Unless you’re utilizing this resource, however, just know how troublesome bringing large pieces of luggage can be. For starters, larger pieces aren’t allowed on some buses. If you have wheels on your luggage, be aware that many of the sidewalks you’ll be rolling your bags on are cobblestone and therefore, aren’t the easiest to roll your suitcase across. Finally, and most importantly, trips to the train station or subway station always involve a plethora of stairs that you would need to hoist your suitcase up and down.

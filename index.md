## Transportation

### JR Pass

After [comparing our itinerary’s train costs](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) with the Japan Rail Pass, we opted for the [Kansai-Hokuriku Area Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_kansai_hokuriku.html). The varying JR Passes provide unlimited use of various shinkansen, limited express trains, local trains, and even some buses. It’s important to note that while the JR Pass covers the entire country, regional passes are specific to certain areas, so research before purchasing is crucial.

#### Exchange Orders and Ticket Vending Machines

JR regional passes can be bought on JR West, JR East, or JR Central websites, the JR global website, or through third-party travel agencies (we used Klook, saving a few dollars). Whether purchased through Japan Rail or not, you receive a physical or virtual voucher __(read: exchange order)__ that needs to be exchanged for a physical pass __in person__. This can be done at a ticket vending machine or ticket office, but __regional passes can only be exchanged at their respective JR stations.__

As we chose the Kansai-Hokuriku Pass, a JR West Pass, we had to go to a JR West station to exchange our voucher. For us, this meant stopping in Toyama for the pass before heading to Kanazawa. This minor inconvenience was overshadowed by the fact that the Shinkansen ride from Toyama to Kanazawa was fully covered by our new, shiny pass. [Photo of Kansai-Hokuriku Area Pass]

Note that JR West’s “Green Ticket Machines” differ from JR East’s ticket vending machines so the process is slightly different. 

In order to receive your physical pass you’ll need to:
1. Find the correct ticket machine with the Passport logo above the screen ![Passport](/assets/jrpassport.png).  [Insert Photo of Green Ticket Machine]
2. Select “Receive Reserved Tickets”
3. Select Exchange Order
4. Scan your voucher’s QR Code.
5. Enter the effective date (usually the same day).
6. Agree to the Terms and Conditions 
7. When prompted, scan your passport
8. Once the machine reads your passport, the tickets will print.

##### Important Notes:
- The physical credit card used to purchase the voucher online may be required. Avoid using numberless or virtual cards.
- The pass validity starts and ends at midnight, counting the effective date as a full day regardless of when you receive it.
- To exchange your voucher at a Green Ticket Machine, your passport must have a biometric chip (look for this symbol on your passport) ![Biometric](/assets/biometric.png)
- Exchange your voucher within 90 days of purchase; don't buy it more than 90 days before your trip
With your JR Pass in hand, you'll likely want to do one of three things: hop on a city bus, take a train, or reserve your seat for a shinkansen/limited express.
